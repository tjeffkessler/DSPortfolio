# NLP Essay Grader

The goal of this project is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) tool that can provide automatic feedback on essays to students and teachers.
This feedback would be used to help students decide where to focus their revision efforts and help teachers focus on what aspects of the essay may need more detailed constructive feedback.

## Phase I
Using labeled essay data from the Hewlett Foundation, compare the computed organization scores of essays with the hand-graded scores to determine model accuracy and the effectiveness of the organization scoring function.
